                    Recent papers from Meta (Facebook) and Google <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11245" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub51477/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3</a></sup> have created a major concern about data integrity in large-scale computing in cloud data centers. The term “mercurial cores” has been coined <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a></sup> to refer to errant processor cores that have been clearly diagnosed as being the source of generating silent data errors – and recent panels (as referred to above) have brought together experts from cloud service providers and processor chip designers with the objective of raising awareness of this acute problem, and also encouraging leading edge research to devise affordable chip and system-level mitigation solutions. In addition to such data integrity concerns, the rise of data security and privacy breaches in cloud computing environments has accelerated research and development of practical solutions that enable computing with encrypted data (e.g., advanced cryptographic methods like Fully Homomorphic Computing or FHE); e.g., recent papers <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527393" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527415" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05371" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.

                    <p>
					This workshop (<strong>DISCC-2023</strong>) proposes to bring together aspects of data integrity and security in a single, unified forum. The workshop will comprise of a keynote speech (or two), several contributed papers and, time permitting, a closing panel session involving leading edge experts in data integrity and security in a hyper-scale cloud computing setting. Potential speakers are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages) highlighting the key contributions in the light of the above-stated technical scope of the problem. Solution approaches at the algorithm, software/firmware and/or hardware level are encouraged for early dissemination and discussion in a workshop setting. Papers dealing with testing (or detection, diagnosis) of silent data errors or of malicious data breaches are solicited. Similarly, cost-effective mitigation solutions are invited for presentation.

Defecticon synthesizes customized test cases for each CPU core based on their characteristics, and provides APIs for developers to integrate the generated test cases to their applications. To generate customized test cases, Defecticon first identifies a set of potentially defective flip-flops and gates on each core, via scan-based testing with an intentionally reduced, abnormal voltage. Defecticon then uses symbolic execution and/or bounded model checking to generate the test case as an instruction sequence that, once executed, propagates the potential defects to a software-visible state like a general purpose register or the L1 cache. Finally, Defecticon generates the necessary assertions to identify the defects, and stores the test case in a way that can be loaded and executed for each core at application runtime.">

In this work, we propose the adoption of Coded Computation to mitigate SDE computation errors efficiently. Based upon error correcting codes (ECC), which have been proven valuable to the mitigation of SDEs in storage and communication, coded computation performs computations in parallel that are homomorphic to ECC encoding/decoding functions, thus tolerating a configurable amount of computation errors. We first give a motivating example to compare coded computation with the traditional Triple Modular Redundancy. Then we introduce the state-of-the-art coded computation, their applications to SDEs mitigation mechanisms, and open questions for future work.">

Pruning the parameters of a NN model is a well-known approach to improving inference latency. However, pruning methods that are useful in the plaintext context may lend nearly negligible improvement in the HE case. In this work, we propose a novel set of pruning methods that reduce the latency and memory requirement, thus bringing the effectiveness of plaintext pruning methods to HE. We evaluate our methods on an autoencoder architecture on MNIST and show that our best method prunes ∼2× more ciphertexts than our adaptation of a state-of-the-art scheme called Hunter, for negligible increase in mean-square reconstruction loss.">

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows such computations in the ciphertext space. The result remains in encrypted form and can only be decrypted by using the secret key. Due to its high degree of security, FHE has been adopted widely for applications based on medical or genomic data processing. Though FHE has been shown to be secure, side channels emanating from its operations on underlying hardware have not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we analyze the memory access patterns emanating from FHE-encrypted applications. For an example database query-based application, we show that memory access patterns from different queries can be distinguished by a well-resourced adversary. With the aid of ML-based classifiers, we can predict whether or not a query belongs to an entry in the database, with ∼90% accuracy.">
