                    Recent papers from Meta (Facebook) and Google <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11245" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub51477/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3</a></sup> have created a major concern about data integrity in large-scale computing in cloud data centers. The term “mercurial cores” has been coined <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a></sup> to refer to errant processor cores that have been clearly diagnosed as being the source of generating silent data errors – and recent panels (as referred to above) have brought together experts from cloud service providers and processor chip designers with the objective of raising awareness of this acute problem, and also encouraging leading edge research to devise affordable chip and system-level mitigation solutions. In addition to such data integrity concerns, the rise of data security and privacy breaches in cloud computing environments has accelerated research and development of practical solutions that enable computing with encrypted data (e.g., advanced cryptographic methods like Fully Homomorphic Computing or FHE); e.g., recent papers <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527393" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527415" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05371" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.

                    <p>
					This workshop (<strong>DISCC-2023</strong>) proposes to bring together aspects of data integrity and security in a single, unified forum. The workshop will comprise of a keynote speech (or two), several contributed papers and, time permitting, a closing panel session involving leading edge experts in data integrity and security in a hyper-scale cloud computing setting. Potential speakers are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages) highlighting the key contributions in the light of the above-stated technical scope of the problem. Solution approaches at the algorithm, software/firmware and/or hardware level are encouraged for early dissemination and discussion in a workshop setting. Papers dealing with testing (or detection, diagnosis) of silent data errors or of malicious data breaches are solicited. Similarly, cost-effective mitigation solutions are invited for presentation.

				  data-container="body" data-placement="top" data-content="With the monetization of user data, data breaches in the cloud have become very common. In
				  2022, there were close to 2,000 data breaches in the cloud, with the global average cost per data breach close to $5M. Therefore, the need for
				  maintaining data security and privacy is becoming increasingly critical. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has emerged as a potential solution as it
				  enables computing on encrypted data. With FHE, one can provide strong data security and privacy guarantees. Unfortunately, operating on encrypted data
				  is slow. We need innovations on both the cloud side and edge side to make FHE-based cloud computing practical.<br><br>
				  In this talk, I'll first use our FHE profiling results to discuss opportunities and challenges for FHE-based cloud computing. Then I'll present our
				  recent work (on both the cloud side and edge side) towards making FHE-based cloud computing practical. For accelerating the cloud-side operations,
				  I'll present our efforts on Memory-Aware Design (MAD) techniques for FHE, an FPGA-based Accelerator for Bootstrappable FHE (FAB), and GPU-based
				  Microarchitectural Extensions (GME) for FHE. For accelerating the edge-side operations, I'll present our work on RISC-V SoC for En/decryption Acceleration (RISE).">

							  Recently, there has been a significant increase in privacy-protected, encrypted computation.
							  The promise of effective hardware acceleration to bring paradigms like FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) within the realms of
							  practical deployment has fueled newer innovations in the algorithm (software) aspects of this domain as well. At the same time, we
							  have seen an escalating level of concern about the incidence of silent data corruption (SDC) and other failure modes in recent years.
							  We have two excellent invited talks to set the stage for an engaging conversation about this topic. One of the talks describes a
							  leading edge hardware accelerator for FHE computing and the other one talks about novel ways of SDC detection in normal (plaintext)
							  computation.<br>
