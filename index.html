                    Recent papers from Meta (Facebook) and Google <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11245" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub51477/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3</a></sup> have created a major concern about data integrity in large-scale computing in cloud data centers. The term “mercurial cores” has been coined <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465297" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a></sup> to refer to errant processor cores that have been clearly diagnosed as being the source of generating silent data errors – and recent panels (as referred to above) have brought together experts from cloud service providers and processor chip designers with the objective of raising awareness of this acute problem, and also encouraging leading edge research to devise affordable chip and system-level mitigation solutions. In addition to such data integrity concerns, the rise of data security and privacy breaches in cloud computing environments has accelerated research and development of practical solutions that enable computing with encrypted data (e.g., advanced cryptographic methods like Fully Homomorphic Computing or FHE); e.g., recent papers <sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527393" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470496.3527415" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05371" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.

                    <p>
					This workshop (<strong>DISCC-2023</strong>) proposes to bring together aspects of data integrity and security in a single, unified forum. The workshop will comprise of a keynote speech (or two), several contributed papers and, time permitting, a closing panel session involving leading edge experts in data integrity and security in a hyper-scale cloud computing setting. Potential speakers are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages) highlighting the key contributions in the light of the above-stated technical scope of the problem. Solution approaches at the algorithm, software/firmware and/or hardware level are encouraged for early dissemination and discussion in a workshop setting. Papers dealing with testing (or detection, diagnosis) of silent data errors or of malicious data breaches are solicited. Similarly, cost-effective mitigation solutions are invited for presentation.

Instead of the soft errors that have previously been a main focus of online error detection schemes, many of these errors seem to be arising from test escapes, latent defects, or the impact of aging.  As a result, repeated field testing is becoming a critical need to find these defects and prevent SDC.  To do this well, field testing must be both highly effective and efficient.   This talk will present several Design for Test (DFT) circuit structures that can be used to make the best use of test time in the field—in some cases allowing the number of effective patterns applied to grow by a factor of 50, 100, or more without increasing test time.">

               <h4>Daniel Sanchez (MIT)</h4>
               <p>Daniel Sanchez is an Associate Professor at MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He works in computer architecture and computer systems. His current research focuses on large-scale multicores with hundreds to thousands of cores, scalable and efficient memory hierarchies, architectures with quality-of-service guarantees, and scalable runtimes and schedulers.
Before joining MIT in September 2012, He earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, where he worked with Professor Christos Kozyrakis. Daniel Sanchez has also received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford (2009) and a B.S. in Telecommunications Engineering from the Technical University of Madrid, UPM (2007).

							  <!--
							  This panel will debate the future of AI from the view point of society in general and computer architects/scientists in particular.
							  In many ways, the first indications of scary excitement (beyond normal science fiction giddiness) came in 2011, with Ken Jennings
							  (human Jeopardy champion) uttering those famous words: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSBzKbecmo" target="_blank">«I for
							  one welcome our new computer overlords!»</a>. Since then, with the steady and steep rise of AI/ML capabilities, the awe and excitement
							  seems to be turning into downright panic, given the statements being made by some of the modern-day pioneers/catalysts of the AI/ML
							  revolution as well as notable other scientists and intellectuals.<br>
							  After the panelists provide their position statements, the floor will be open for Q&A, with questions posed from the audience.
